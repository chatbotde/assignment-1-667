🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING
=================

Common Issues and Solutions:

1. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'"
   → pip install numpy matplotlib pandas

2. "No module named 'tkinter'"
   → Linux: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   → Windows/Mac: Reinstall Python with tkinter

3. Import errors between modules
   → Always run from project root directory
   → Don't run from subdirectories

4. Test failures
   → Run: python test_plan.py for detailed diagnostics
   → Check dependencies with project_status.py

5. Performance issues
   → Reduce number of blade elements in user_inputs.py

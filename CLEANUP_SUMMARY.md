# Code Cleanup Summary

## Removed Redundant Components

### 1. Deleted `demo_script.py`
- **Reason**: Completely redundant with interactive GUI
- **Impact**: Eliminated 150+ lines of duplicate code
- **Benefit**: Removes automated demo that duplicated GUI functionality

### 2. Simplified GUI Data Management
- **Reduced data buffer**: From 100 to 20 data points
- **Removed CSV export**: Eliminated unnecessary file I/O operations
- **Simplified performance metrics**: Removed redundant efficiency calculations

### 3. Optimized Update Frequency
- **Reduced from 10 Hz to 5 Hz**: Less frequent updates for better performance
- **Impact**: 50% reduction in calculation frequency
- **Benefit**: Lower CPU usage while maintaining smooth visualization

### 4. Streamlined Component Model
- **Removed mass data**: Not needed for GUI display
- **Simplified to essential components**: Main rotor, tail rotor, CG only
- **Benefit**: Reduced memory footprint and initialization time

### 5. Removed Unnecessary Features
- **CSV data export functionality**: Not essential for assignment demonstration
- **Redundant performance displays**: Removed efficiency calculation
- **Excessive component details**: Kept only what's needed for physics

## Performance Improvements

### Runtime Optimization
- **50% fewer GUI updates**: 5 Hz instead of 10 Hz
- **80% less data buffering**: 20 points instead of 100
- **Eliminated file I/O**: No CSV export operations
- **Reduced calculation overhead**: Simplified performance metrics

### Memory Usage
- **Smaller data buffers**: 5x reduction in stored data points
- **Simplified component model**: Removed unnecessary mass properties
- **Cleaner object structure**: Fewer variables to track

### Code Maintainability
- **Single GUI implementation**: No duplicate interfaces
- **Centralized calculations**: All physics in `rotor_utils.py`
- **Reduced complexity**: Fewer features to maintain
- **Clear separation**: GUI vs. physics calculations

## Preserved Essential Features

### Core Functionality Maintained
- ✅ Real-time forces and moments calculation
- ✅ Interactive control sliders
- ✅ Live plotting of F&M data
- ✅ Component placement effects
- ✅ Aircraft reference frame
- ✅ All bonus task requirements

### Physics Accuracy
- ✅ BEMT calculations unchanged
- ✅ Rotor performance models intact
- ✅ Force/moment transformations preserved
- ✅ Component positioning effects maintained

## Expected Benefits

### Performance
- **Faster startup**: Reduced initialization overhead
- **Lower CPU usage**: Fewer calculations per second
- **Reduced memory**: Smaller data structures
- **Smoother operation**: Less GUI update overhead

### Maintainability
- **Single codebase**: No duplicate GUI implementations
- **Cleaner structure**: Focused on essential features
- **Easier debugging**: Fewer components to track
- **Better organization**: Clear separation of concerns

## Files Modified
- `helicopter_simulator_gui.py`: Simplified and optimized
- `demo_script.py`: **DELETED** (redundant)
- `rotor_utils.py`: Unchanged (core physics preserved)

## Lines of Code Reduced
- **Deleted**: ~150 lines (demo_script.py)
- **Simplified**: ~50 lines (GUI optimizations)
- **Total reduction**: ~200 lines of code

The cleanup maintains all assignment requirements while significantly improving performance and reducing complexity.

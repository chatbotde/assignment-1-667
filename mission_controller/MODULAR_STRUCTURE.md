# Mission Controller Modular Structure

The mission controller has been refactored into smaller, more manageable modules for better maintainability and organization.

## File Structure

```

## Module Descriptions

### core.py
- Contains core data structures: `MissionStatus`, `FlightParameters`, `MissionCommand`
- Shared by all other modules
- No dependencies on other modules

### system_init.py
- Handles initialization of flight simulation and mission planner systems
- Contains `SystemInitializer` class
- Validates system compatibility

### flight_analysis.py
- Handles flight parameter calculations and performance analysis
- Contains `FlightAnalyzer` class
- Calculates thrust, power, efficiency, etc.

### mission_executor.py
- Handles mission execution, monitoring, and command processing
- Contains `MissionExecutor` class
- Manages mission lifecycle and command queue

### report_generator.py
- Generates mission reports and status monitoring
- Contains `ReportGenerator` class
- Formats output for users

### mission_types.py
- Contains predefined mission configurations
- Contains `MissionTypes` class with static methods
- Handles mission segment validation

### feasibility_analyzer.py
- Analyzes mission feasibility and performance requirements
- Contains `FeasibilityAnalyzer` class
- Checks power limits, tip Mach, etc.

### mission_controller.py (Simplified)
- Main controller class that orchestrates all modules
- Much smaller and cleaner than before
- Acts as a facade for the modular components

### mission_interface.py (Simplified)
- High-level API for mission operations
- Uses the modular components through composition
- Cleaner and more focused interface

## Benefits of Modular Structure

1. **Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Modules can be reused in different contexts
4. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand
5. **Extensibility**: New features can be added as new modules
6. **Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific modules

## Usage

The interface remains the same for existing code:

```python
from mission_controller import MissionController, MissionInterface

# Use as before
controller = MissionController()
interface = MissionInterface()
```

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- The public API remains unchanged
- Internal structure is now modular
- Each module can be imported individually if needed
- Better error isolation and debugging capabilities
